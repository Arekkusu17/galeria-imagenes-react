## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm start`
 `npm test`
 `npm run build`
 `npm run eject`



## Work Done
- Create the Header.jsx component, I used bootstrap so i wrote a navbar that only has text. The text on the navbar come from props.
- Since it is an image gallery, i decide to use the cards components of bootstrap to create a Card.jsx. I think of the cards as a canvas that with a description and the author of the image. Thats why all the info needed (title,url,author,info,alt-text) come from props.

- Create Footer.jsx, I decided to use this section to redirect the user to the full gallery if they liked the pictures. That way the would enjoy more.

- Add the Readme.
